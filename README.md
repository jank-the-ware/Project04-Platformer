Title
The Monster Out From Under the Bed

10/26
## Description
You are The Monster Out From Under the Bed - better known as Weeks. Weeks is a reclusive devilspawn, and minor player in the major criminal overworld of Ferri. But this might be your big break. New players are in town, and the old ones are going out, but Weeks is just small enough to go under the radar, and get in on this power vaccuum. All you need to do is make it out of the Fairface Caverns and to the lavish Mavrikos House to get the leverage you needs to get a step up.
## Implementation
- 2 different levels (cave & city)
- Student created player & enemy sprites
- Student created (some) tilesets
- 3 unique enemies (walking, pouncing, shooting)
- Play can attack w/ sword
